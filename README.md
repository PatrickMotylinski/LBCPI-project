# LBCPI-project

LBCPI is short for Location-Based Consumer Preference Inferrence. The ultimate goal of this project is to create a framework which allows inferring consumer preferences based on the user location.

plt2SQLite.py : 
When run in \<PATH to GeoLife\>/  it organizes all the user trajectories in a SQLite database. 

LBCPI.ipynb   : 
Notebook used for initial data inspection/crude analysis.
